# lung-cancer-classification-knn

We have conducted a research study to detect lung cancer by developing knn classification technique. CT Scans are converted to greyscale for pre-processing, Gabor filter is then used on the grayscale images to obtain enhanced images. These enhanced images are then passed into Otsuâ€™s thresholding for noise reduction and brightening of faint pixels. The noise-reduced images are passed into GLCM to extract features such as homogeneity, energy, entropy, etc. into a .csv dataset. The dataset obtained is passed into a kNN classification model to classify lung cancer.
We have combined image enhancement, feature extraction, and machine learning methods which shows an accuracy of 92.37%.
